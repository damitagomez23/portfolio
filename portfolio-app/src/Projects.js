                            <li>This was a group project for my population health informatics class.</li>
                            <li>The purpose of this project was to answer the question <em>What is more effective at preventing suicide:
                                increasing mental health facilities or human resources?</em></li>
                            <li>As a group, we looked at taking data from the World Health Organization and researched mental health from
                                multiple perspectives outside of the data to look for the best ways to answer this question for our
                                analysis.</li>

                            <li>Title: <em>Assignment 3</em> (sorry, this was not a major project, so there's not an official title)</li>
                            <li>This project was for an assignment for my population health informatics class to practice creating
                                ShinyApps and using datasets for topic research.</li>
                            <li>- For the record, I am not an expert in population health and cannot speak to the accuracy of the models.
                                These were my best efforts of prediction based on the data I had and what I was learning at the time.</li>

                            <li>This project is my own continuation of a group project I was a part of in school. I am still working on
                                this out of my own interest and curiosity.</li>

                            <li>This was a website that I developed with another student for UW's Pokemon Club.</li>
                            <li>It features club announcements and an interactive calendar that my partner and I constructed.</li>
                            <li>It utilizes a Firebase database in a React app to pull calendar events and register users.</li>
                            <li>The club has fallen apart, but <a href="https://info340d-au18.github.io/project-stluongxd/" target="_blank">the website</a>
                            is still running with a fully functioning calendar! ðŸ¥´</li>

                            <li>Title: <em>Compare Universities</em></li>
                            <li>This project is much older and has not been touched in a while.</li>
                            <li>It was another group project where we built everything in R and used a ShinyApp to launch the final
                                product.</li>
                            <li>The goal was to allow users a way to compare different universities by various attributes such as
                                location, academic interests, or college types.</li>
                            <li>I built the <em>Academic Majors</em> page and all of its interactive features as my main contribution to the
                                project.</li>
